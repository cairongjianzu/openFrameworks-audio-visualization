The domo shows the concept of **audio visualization** using  c++.<br /><br />
**The domo mainly uses particle to construct a force field, using to display graphics like showing the dancing effect of  letters.
And the Dynamic change show the concept of audio visualization.<br /><br />**
In order to build a **force field** , we should consider the particle position,moving vector, force vector, resistance coefficient 
and the corresponding change point repulsion and attraction.<br /><br />
In the demo , it shows the effect of **particle gathering**, like:<br />

and when you press the button ,it would show **different alphabet**,like:<br />

it also uses dancing line to show **audio visualization**,like:<br />

The visual effect is not good enough ,it can be improve more dynamic and rael-time-responsive.
